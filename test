//Write a program to find the total number of digits used in the number sequence from MIN = 12 to
// MAX = 1200 . The program should be generically written for any MIN and MAX numbers entered by the user.
//Example: If the user enters the MIN value = 8 and MAX value = 12; then the program should output the total number of digits used in the sequence as 8. 
//Since the numbers to be counted are = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
//8 and 9 are single digits. Total digits therefore is 2 in the first two numbers.
//10,11,12 are two digit numbers. Total digit therefore is 2 X 3 = 6 digits.
//Thus, all the digits counted make it 8. 
//Give your output result for the sequence of numbers from MIN Value = 12 to MAX Value = 1200.
